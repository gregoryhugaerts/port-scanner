# Report on Ethical Considerations of Port Scanning

## Introduction

Port scanning is a technique used for discovering open ports on a computer. It is a valuable tool for assessing a networks security, but requires some considerations

## Considerations

- Consent:
one of the primary considerations of port scanning is obtaining proper authorization before scanning a network or system. Unauthorized port scanning may violate laws and regulations related to computer security and privacy.

> we are scanning only our own pc and vms. team members have given each other permission to do so.

- Intent:
the motive behind port scanning is critical. While it can bolster security by uncovering vulnerabilities, malicious intent can lead to unauthorized access and cyber threats.

> we are scanning only to learn more about how port scanning works, without malicious intent

- Harm Mitigation: Aggressive scans can disrupt services or trigger security alerts.

> we are only scanning our own machines, so this isn't a consideration in this case.
