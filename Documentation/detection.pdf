# Detecting Port Scanning Activities

## Introduction

Port scanning is a technique that is often used to find weak points in computer networks.

## Detection Techniques

- Network Intrusion Detection Systems
Uses signature-based detection techniques to compare network traffic against known patterns associated with port scanning.

- Firewall Logging and Analysis: Firewalls can log incoming and outgoing traffic, including port scanning attempts.

- Honeypots: Decoy system specifically designed to attract attacks. Any traffic to them is suspicious
